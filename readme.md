## GIT _The Scoop_ Newsletter.
### Content
The Scoop newsletter is organized in the following order:
* Hero
* Jobs and Internships
    * Student
    * Internships
    * Part-Time
    * Full-Time
* Scholarships
* Student Resources
* Announcements
* Events
* Student Clubs

#### Hero
The hero image is updated every week, highlighting any on-campus or off-campus events, competitions, scholarships, etc.

#### Jobs and Internships
Student jobs are positions offered by the university across all campuses. However, the ASU job posting cannot be linked directly on the newsletter because it requires the user to login with their ASUrite information. Because of this, "Apply through ASU" is hyperlinked to the ASU Student Employment Job Search page (https://students.asu.edu/employment/search). The requisition ID is included so interested students can look up the position themselves.

Job descriptions should short with the following format: _Department/Person_ seeks a student to/for _Responsibilities_.
Hyperlinks for job description links could inlude "Apply through ASU", "Learn more and apply online", "Contact _person_ for more information".  

Trello is used to organize newsletter content every week.
* "To Remove" column contains content that is past due/closed and should be removed.
    * It is best to do this before adding new content.
* "To-Do Current Week" contains content that will be added to the upcoming newsletter. When each card is complete, the coder will move the card to the "Done/Leave in This Week" column. 
    * Keep the cards in the order they will appear in The Scoop newsletter.*

# Resources

Resources, as it applies to the GIT Creative Agency, concern a variety of tools, images, templates, software, plugins, photos, and other items. These don't belong to any one project, but instead can be used again and again as needed. Resources can arrive from a variety of sources, whether purchased, found, or created whole.

It is encouraged for every member of the Agency to continually add to the Resources folder on our shared Drive, sorting items into their logical place. New folders can be created, but care should always be taken to maintain a tidy folder structure, especially at the top-most level.

In time, we plan to build a Resources page on the web, perhaps based on skullface's [design resources project](https://github.com/skullface/design-resources) on GitHub. That, ideally, would leverage more articles, web tools, and book listings — an industry-related directory, rather than a bucket of files for the daily grind.

## How We Work on Projects

### File Management Structure

### File Naming

Organise our files as we organise our thinking.

1. Use as few files as possible.

2. Name files sequentially according to the project hierarchy
	1. Project no.
	2. Client name
	3. Project name
	4. Stage
	5. Date
	6. Modification, if any

3. Use the date convention YYYYMMDD, where dates get a leading zero

4. Use the time convention HHMM, where we use 24-hour time and leading zeroes.

5. Use hyphens, not underscores.

6. Do not use initials or names of individuals.

7. Never, never, never use "final" anywhere in a file name.

### File Types

1. The GIT Creative Agency is an Adobe studio. We default to the Adobe Creative Cloud and the main tool within it for the job. 
2. Avoid Microsoft Office as a whole. Instead of Word, use Google Docs. Instead of Excel, use Google Sheets. Instead of Powerpoint, use InDesign (and eventually export as PDF).
	_Only use Google Slides or Keynote for presentations where it is *essential* to import video, audio, animated gifs, or other complex elements. Otherwise, prefer a simple PDF slideshow._
3. For working files, retain the original, layered file as long as possible. This means saving Photoshop (`.psd`), Illustrator (`.ai`), InDesign (`.indd`), Premiere (`.prproj`), and other proprietary formats from our main design software tools.
4. For export files, save as a common format, and where possible an open-source format. Images should become hi-res `.jpg` or `.tif`, vector art will become `.eps`, and layouts will be exported as `.pdf`. 
5. For simple documents, such as this readme, use `.md` or `.txt`. Do not "complicate" a text file by elevating it to Google Docs.

## Communication Within Agency Members

We will use Slack as our principal communication tool. Don't use email when a Slack message will do.
