# Resources

Resources, as it applies to the GIT Creative Agency, concern a variety of tools, images, templates, software, plugins, photos, and other items. These don't belong to any one project, but instead can be used again and again as needed. Resources can arrive from a variety of sources, whether purchased, found, or created whole.

It is encouraged for every member of the Agency to continually add to the Resources folder on our shared Drive, sorting items into their logical place. New folders can be created, but care should always be taken to maintain a tidy folder structure, especially at the top-most level.

In time, we plan to build a Resources page on the web, perhaps based on skullface's [design resources project](https://github.com/skullface/design-resources) on GitHub. That, ideally, would leverage more articles, web tools, and book listings — an industry-related directory, rather than a bucket of files for the daily grind.

# Operations

## Communication Within Agency Members

We will use Slack as our principal communication tool. Don't use email when a Slack message will do.
