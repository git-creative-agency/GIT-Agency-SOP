## GIT _The Scoop_ Newsletter.
### Content
The Scoop newsletter is organized in the following order:
* Hero
* Jobs and Internships
    * Student
    * Internships
    * Part-Time
    * Full-Time
* Scholarships
* Student Resources
* Announcements
* Events
* Student Clubs

#### Hero
The hero image is updated every week, highlighting any on-campus or off-campus events, competitions, scholarships, etc.

#### Jobs and Internships
Student jobs are positions offered by the university across all campuses. However, the ASU job posting cannot be linked directly on the newsletter because it requires the user to login with their ASUrite information. Because of this, "Apply through ASU" is hyperlinked to the ASU Student Employment Job Search page (https://students.asu.edu/employment/search). The requisition ID is included so interested students can look up the position themselves.

Job descriptions should short with the following format: _Department/Person_ seeks a student to/for _Responsibilities_.
Hyperlinks for job description links could inlude "Apply through ASU", "Learn more and apply online", "Contact _person_ for more information".  

Trello is used to organize newsletter content every week.
* "To Remove" column contains content that is past due/closed and should be removed.
    * It is best to do this before adding new content.
* "To-Do Current Week" contains content that will be added to the upcoming newsletter. When each card is complete, the coder will move the card to the "Done/Leave in This Week" column. 
    * Keep the cards in the order they will appear in The Scoop newsletter.*

## Communication Within Agency Members

We will use Slack as our principal communication tool. Don't use email when a Slack message will do.
