Trello is used to organize newsletter content every week.
- "To Remove" column contains content that is past due/closed and should be removed.
    - It is best to do this before adding new content.
- "To-Do Current Week" contains content that will be added to the upcoming newsletter. When each card is complete, the coder will move the card to the "Done/Leave in This Week" column. 
    - *Keep the cards in the order they will appear in The Scoop newsletter.*
