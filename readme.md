## GIT _The Scoop_ Newsletter.

*The Scoop* requires three main efforts:

1. Content
1. Code/Design
1. Scheduling & Publish

### Content
The Scoop newsletter is organized in the following order:
* Hero
* Jobs and Internships
    * Student
    * Internships
    * Part-Time
    * Full-Time
    * Contract Work (temporary)
* Scholarships
* Student Resources
* Announcements
* Events
* Student Clubs

#### Hero
The hero image is updated every week, highlighting any on-campus or off-campus events, competitions, scholarships, etc.

#### Jobs and Internships
Student jobs are positions offered by the university across all campuses. However, the ASU job posting cannot be linked directly on the newsletter because it requires the user to login with their ASUrite information. Because of this, "Apply through ASU" is hyperlinked to the ASU Student Employment Job Search page (https://students.asu.edu/employment/search). The requisition ID is included so interested students can look up the position themselves.

Job descriptions should short with the following format: _Department/Person_ seeks a student to/for _Responsibilities_.
Hyperlinks for job description links could inlude "Apply through ASU", "Learn more and apply online", "Contact _person_ for more information".  

Trello is used to organize newsletter content every week.
* "To Remove" column contains content that is past due/closed and should be removed.
    * It is best to do this before adding new content.
* "To-Do Current Week" contains content that will be added to the upcoming newsletter. When each card is complete, the coder will move the card to the "Done/Leave in This Week" column. 
    * Keep the cards in the order they will appear in The Scoop newsletter.* 
    

### Coding


### Scheduling
MailChimp is used to schedule the newsletter. Login information can be found in Government Secrets and The Scoop How-To presentation.
* Create a new EMAIL campaign in MailChimp with title "theScoop-YYYYMMDD-mainTopic" where The name *The Scoop* is followed by the date, and amended with a simple note about the main hero image or theme of that issue (example: theScoop-20190216-AdobeJam)
* Set up the following for the email:
* "To" select GIT students
    * MailChimp will automatically complete "From" and "Subject" sections.
    * Select "Edit Subject" and add this week's preview text, then save.

#### Inline Code
MailChimp requires inline code for the email:
* Use the <a href="https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/">"MailChimp CSS inliner tool</a> to inline code
* Copy/Paste the *complete* code for The Scoop in the textbox then click "Convert"
    * Your inlined code will appear in the textbox just below

Back in the campaign under "Content", click Design Email->Code Your Own
* Copy/Paste the inlined code in the text area of Code Your Own
    * You will see a preview of your email on the left

* Save and send a test email to yourself and Jessica.

* Make any changes/edits necessary. Update the file in your webspace, in MailChimp, send new test emails with every update until approved.

* Go to "Schedule" in the top right of the campaign.
* Select the date newsletter will be sent, and choose _"Let MailChimp choose best time to send"_

* Click "Schedule" and Scoop process is complete.



## GIT Program Social Media & Branding
## GIT Program Social Media 
GIT SOCIAL MEDIA
GOAL: The goal of the GIT social media is to keep GIT students up to date on events, involved, and informed. Additionally, it is also a way to reach out to future students to offer guidance and access to the community. It is also an outlet to share and celebrate our GIT Student's work. Our tonal goal for the GIT Program social media is to engage in a casual way, but remain professional with our content. Post goal is twice a week for each platform.
WHEN TO POST:
Facebook: 9AM - 2PM
	Worst day: Sunday
Instagram: Wednesday at 11 a.m. and Friday at 10–11 a.m
	Worst day: Sunday
Twitter: Wednesday at 9 a.m. and Friday at 9 a.m
	Worst day: Saturday

## GIT Program Branding
* Follow the GIT brand guide.
## GIT Agency Social Media
GOAL: The goal for the Agency specific accounts is similar to the GIT program social media, but we will approach with a more casual and individualistic tone. The social media for the agency should focus on the agency itself. This can include agency projects, events, agency member work, or helpful links and/or agency “recommended” resources. 

WHEN TO POST: 
When to post on different social media accounts is the same as the GIT Program data but with more leniency because of the more casual tone.

## Projects and Meetings (notes from 4-8-2019)

* Do not show your client work that has not been seen by your supervisor.
* Do not use Illustrator for text, use InDesign.
* Keep file naming and storage in in check
* Communication, constant updates




## When Projects Begin

Give it a codename.

# Resources

Resources, as it applies to the GIT Creative Agency, concern a variety of tools, images, templates, software, plugins, photos, and other items. These don't belong to any one project, but instead can be used again and again as needed. Resources can arrive from a variety of sources, whether purchased, found, or created whole.

It is encouraged for every member of the Agency to continually add to the Resources folder on our shared Drive, sorting items into their logical place. New folders can be created, but care should always be taken to maintain a tidy folder structure, especially at the top-most level.

In time, we plan to build a Resources page on the web, perhaps based on skullface's [design resources project](https://github.com/skullface/design-resources) on GitHub. That, ideally, would leverage more articles, web tools, and book listings — an industry-related directory, rather than a bucket of files for the daily grind.

# Operations

## How We Work on Projects

Make sure to have a project update before each class. 

### File Management Structure

The overarching premise is simple: At all times, all files must be available to all Agency members. This means working _only_ on the shared drive — currently Google Drive — using a local+cloud sync effort, in this case Google Drive File Stream desktop app for Mac and Windows. 

All files must be uploaded to the team drive and named with the proper naming convention. Everything will be stored in an intuitive way such that any other team member can find any file, and where needed, continue work.

* Files that have not been presented to a client should be considered "Concepts", and can move to "Refinements" after some decision is made. Still plenty of work to do after this designation switch.
* PDFs and anything that is in preparation should be in "Review" folder
 

### File Naming

Organise our files as we organise our thinking.

1. Use as few files as possible. Within those files, as few pages as possible. Within those pages, as few layers as possible, as few items as possible, as few styles as possible. Keep it lean.

2. Name files sequentially according to the project hierarchy
	1. Project no.
	2. Client name
	3. Project name
	4. Stage
		1. Sketches
		2. Concepts
		3. Refinements
	5. Date (YYYYMMDD format)
	6. Time (HH:MM (24-hr)) if needeed
	6. Modification, if any

3. Use the date convention YYYYMMDD, where dates get a leading zero

4. Use the time convention HHMM, where we use 24-hour time and leading zeroes.

5. Use hyphens, not underscores.

6. Do not use initials or names of individuals. The date of a file's update is more important than the person who created it.

7. Never, never, never use "final" anywhere in a file name.

### File Types

1. The GIT Creative Agency is an Adobe studio. We default to the Adobe Creative Cloud and the main tools within it for the job. 
2. Avoid Microsoft Office as a whole. Instead of Word, use Google Docs. Instead of Excel, use Google Sheets. Instead of Powerpoint, use InDesign (and eventually export as PDF). However, GIT awards uses powerpoint. 
	_Only use Google Slides or Keynote for presentations where it is *essential* to import video, audio, animated gifs, or other complex elements. Otherwise, prefer a simple PDF slideshow._
3. For working files, retain the original, layered file as long as possible. This means saving Photoshop (`.psd`), Illustrator (`.ai`), InDesign (`.indd`), Premiere (`.prproj`), and other proprietary formats from our main design software tools.
4. For export files, save as a common format, and where possible an open-source format. Images should become hi-res `.jpg` or `.tif`, vector art will become `.eps`, and layouts will be exported as `.pdf`. 
5. For simple documents, such as this readme, use `.md` or `.txt`. Do not "complicate" a text file by elevating it to Google Docs.

## Communication Within Agency Members

We will use Slack as our principal communication tool. Don't use email when a Slack message will do.

### Slack Channels

_We have several channels within the [GIT Program Slack workspace](http://git-asu.slack.com/ "GIT Program Slack workspace") (hosted on ASU's Enterprise Grid). They are listed and described below:_
